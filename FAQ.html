            <h2 class="customH2">What kind of file should I give you?</h2>
            <p>
                The preferred file type is PDF, but I can work with pretty much whatever you give me (JPG, PNG, AI, PSD, TIF, etc.).

            <h2 class="customH2">How do I make my own design?</h2>
            <p>
                If you don't want to use the template, make sure that your design will fit into a perfect circle, otherwise parts might not be visible.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to be thorough and precise, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4ygn6psj6D8NWVGdHFXZGdDU1E">download the template and instructions here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can make your own design with most image editing programs (including MS Paint if you're daring!), but I suggest using a program that allows you use layers, like Photoshop, Illustrator or GIMP (it's free).
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some pictures of what the template would look like printed directly onto a button.
            </p>
            <div>
                <img src="https://spunkybuttons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1up-_button.png" alt="button template">
                <img src="https://spunkybuttons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/example.jpg" alt="printed button template">
                <img src="https://spunkybuttons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/example2.jpg" alt="completed button">
                <img src="https://spunkybuttons.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/example3edge.jpg" alt="completed button edge">
            </div>
            <p>
                It is important to understand that anything outside the circle in the center will start curving around the edge of the button.
                Also, I will add text on the edge for free.

            <h2 class="customH2">Where is the 'text on the edge' of the buttons?</h2>
            <p>
                It's right here!

        <div id="multiDesignHelp">
            <h2 class="customH2">How does pricing work if I want more than one design?</h2>
            <p>
                You pay for the total amount of buttons per order, whether you have 1 design or 10.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example:<br>
                $25 could get you 100 yellow buttons<br>
                OR<br>
                50 blue buttons and 50 red<br>
                OR<br>
                You could even get 100 uniquely designed buttons.
                <br>
                The total amount of buttons is the same in all of these cases, so they cost the same amount. There is currently no limit to the amount of designs per order.

        <div id="buttonSizeHelp">
            <h2 class="customH2">Do you offer different button sizes?</h2>
            <p>
                Currently, I am only able to make 1.25‚Äù buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a very small operation (I'm literally one person), so when I started doing this, I tried to choose a popular and versatile size.
                <br>
                I DO plan on offering different sizes in the future, but I don't know when.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to suggest a different size, <a href="#questionSuggestion">you can leave feedback here.</a> This will help me figure out what other popular sizes are.
